<h3><p>Dash Curran<br>ITP 104<br></p>

<p>Summary:</p>

<p>My site is centered around the FIFA 2022 Qatar World Cup. It is a website filled with information about the tournament, the teams in the tournament, and what has happened so far, as we move into the knockout phase of the tournament. The purpose of my site is to provide a basic overview of the tournament for people who are trying to get into the sport right now. It doesn't include very detailed stats so people that already know alot about the sport may not find it as useful, although I doubt everyone knows all the past winners of the past 50 years! My site is intended to be easy to read and easy to understand, using vibrant colors and large text.</p>

<p>Bullet 11:</p>

<p>To complete bullet 11 on the requirements I used a video tag and a form. My video tag is located on the homepage and is the official trailer of this year's World Cup. My form is located on the newsletter page. It is a signup to receive a newsletter with additional updated World Cup information either daily, weekly, or monthly, although there is no actual newsletter.</p></h3>
