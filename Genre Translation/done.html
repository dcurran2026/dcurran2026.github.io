<p>Improving LA’s public transit system is crucial for creating a more sustainable and equitable urban environment. To do so, the city must first invest in expanding and upgrading its existing bus and rail systems to provide more frequent and reliable service. This means deploying more buses on each route so wait times are shortened, and more people can use the service. More buses would conveniently also mean more job opportunities for LA residents. Furthermore, creating more bus lanes is another crucial step that policymakers can take to improve the public transit system. The city can reduce travel times and make transit more reliable for riders by dedicating lanes exclusively to buses. The city could repurpose existing lanes, such as converting car lanes during peak hours to bus lanes, or build new dedicated lanes along major travel corridors. Creating more bus lanes can also help reduce bus congestion on the city’s roadways, making transit a more attractive option for drivers. More Metro railways are also needed to cover more parts of the city. LA’s previous mayor, Eric Garcetti, envisioned completing 28 rail projects by 2028, including building new Metro lines and extending current ones (<a href="https://medium.com/@adamsusaneck/los-angeles-metro-2020-2060-f44ad04f0fa4" target="_blank">Susaneck</a>). This would be an excellent step in the right direction. To reduce cars on the road and, therefore, road congestion and vehicle emissions, policymakers could look towards introducing a congestion charge at peak hours. This means anyone driving within a particular area at a specific time would have to pay a toll. Fewer people would drive at these times, and more would use public transit to avoid paying the toll. Finally, increased security and fare enforcement is necessary for an enhanced transit system. Fare enforcement will increase revenue for transit companies, resulting in higher-quality transit. Combined with additional security measures like turnstiles, it will improve safety on public transit by discouraging criminal activity and preventing people who threaten public safety from using the system.</p>
