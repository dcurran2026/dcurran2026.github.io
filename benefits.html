<div id="header">The Benefits of Improving the Transit System</div>
<div id="info"><p> Sophisticated transit systems are critical to the social and environmental well-being of Los Angeles. With its sprawling geography and heavy traffic, investing in better transit infrastructure can benefit the city and its residents. One of the most essential benefits of improved public transit in LA is the reduction of road congestion. Public transit will become more widely used by people wanting to avoid the hellish LA traffic by offering a viable alternative to driving. Furthermore, using a bus or railway as a primary transit method encourages people to live a healthier lifestyle that includes more walking. An improved system will also decrease the current public transit times, leading to numerous benefits, particularly for commuters who must travel long distances for work. In 2021, American Lung Association rated LA as the city with the worst ozone pollution in the United States (<a href="https://www.lung.org/getmedia/17c6cb6c-8a38-42a7-a3b0-6744011da370/sota-2021.pdf" target="_blank">“State of the Air 2021”</a>). By getting more people out of their cars and onto public transit, the pollution in the air will decrease, which is a step towards halting climate change. Additionally, residents of LA will breathe cleaner air, leading to a healthier community. Lastly, an improved transit system can foster a sense of community. Public transit can increase social interactions and help build more cohesive communities by connecting people to one another and their surroundings. These interactions can be significant in a diverse and large city like LA, where people may feel disconnected from one another. All in all, a quality public transit system brings many benefits. However, changes to LA’s system must be made first to achieve these benefits. </p>
