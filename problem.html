	<div class="header"> Stigmatization </div>
	<p>There are many reasons why the public transit system in LA is not working as well as other major cities’ transit systems. A key one to note that has little to do with the infrastructure is the negative stigma surrounding public transit in the United States. A study found that users on Twitter express more negative comments about public transit than most other public services. In addition, many of these tweets contain slurs targeting transit users (<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01944363.2014.980439/" target="_blank">Schweitzer</a>). Another study, conducted by Josephine Hazelton-Boyle and Gerard C. Wellman, includes interviews with transit administrators who share their concerns about policy elites, people who hold significant power over public policy decisions. A common finding in these interviews is that transit administrators believe policy elites stigmatize public transit. Their primary concern is that the elites are perceived to view public transit as a social service instead of a necessity. One interviewee shared, “When politicians talk about [public transit] as a social service, people default to the idea in their head that was planted a long time ago about who transit is for and they can go ‘oh yeah, it’s only for those losers’ or they default to the idea that it only serves a few people in society—who in their view aren’t contributing to society, and therefore not worthy of more public funds for transit,” (<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1087724X221088859?journalCode=pwma" target="_blank">Hazelton-Boyle & Wellman</a>). This problem in our society requires addressing the root causes of these perceptions. Why do people stigmatize transit? In Los Angeles, the answer is obvious. The city’s infrastructure is heavily geared towards automobile use, with extensive freeway systems and sprawling suburbs that require cars for mobility. Data collected by Vanderbilt University in 2016 shows that 87.8% of households in Los Angeles owned a vehicle (<a href="https://my.vanderbilt.edu/greencities/files/2019/10/Vehicle-Ownership-in-U.S-2016.pdf" target="_blank">“Vehicle Ownership in U.S. Cities Data”</a>). The bottom line is that having a car in LA is more efficient, and people that can afford to buy a car instead of using public transit most likely will. This is highlighted when looking at the demographic of public transit riders. According to Metro, 75% of its passengers reside in low-income households (<a href="https://thesource.metro.net/2022/10/27/results-of-our-2022-customer-experience-survey/" target="_blank">“Results of our 2022 Customer Experience Survey”</a>). To increase overall ridership across LA, we need to break this negative stigma by making car use less efficient and public transit more efficient.

	<div class="header"> Fare Evasion </div>
	<p>In addition to the stigmatization of public transit in LA, there are other reasons why the transit system is lacking. Fare evasion is a huge issue currently. This problem stems from a need for more enforcement and security. Many Metro railway stations don’t have any turnstiles or gates, making fare evasion a lot easier for those who do not want to pay. Furthermore, there are rarely any security guards on duty. Though slightly less of a cause for concern, there are even cases of people not knowing how to pay due to the poor setup of stations. One Reddit user claimed, “The first week I moved to LA, I didn’t even realize I hadn’t paid when I took the Gold Line for the first time because the [payment] stands are so inconspicuous,” (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LosAngeles/comments/vaksb/why_does_la_not_have_better_metro_security/" target="_blank">alexleavitt</a>). Fare evasion harms Metro and every transit user because it removes funds that could be recycled back into improving public transit. Another point to note is that fare evaders typically cause the most disruptions aboard buses and railways. Gina Osborn, the Chief Safety Officer of the LA Metro, stated in a board meeting in February, “I always say that not all fare evaders are criminals, but all criminals are fare evaders, at least the majority of the people caught on our system committing crimes cannot show proof of fare.” She went on to prove her claim by stating, “In January, of the 109 people arrested [on Metro transit] by LASD, 107 could not show proof of fare and of 57 arrested by LAPD, 50 could not show fare.” (<a href="https://metro.granicus.com/player/clip/2552?view_id=2&redirect=true&h=f2cdd00e68c6db1fbefe441ebca748bc" target="_blank">“Board of Directors - Regular Board Meeting on 2023-02-23”</a>) This point proves that fare enforcement is necessary not only for economic reasons but safety reasons as well. In light of the issues with the current state of LA’s public transit system, it is essential to consider the benefits that can be gained from investing in its improvement.
